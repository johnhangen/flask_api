## Summary ##

I was looking to expand my knowledge of rest APIs along with web scrapping. With this API you can send a request with a stock ticker to get the current price returned in a JSON format. Has docker file to create docker image.



## Future Expansion
* Flask API connected to MySQL server
* Ability to edit using POST, PUT, and Delete
* List of watched stocks stored in .txt
* unit testing
